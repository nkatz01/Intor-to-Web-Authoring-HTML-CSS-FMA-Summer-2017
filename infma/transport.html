						<h2>Get around</h2>
						<p>For any first time visitor to Rome, a visit to the Vatican is a probably a must see prerequisite. Vatican City is just to the north of the city centre of Rome and is easily reached independently by public transport plus of course all the Rome hop on hop off tourist buses stop here too.</p> 
						<p>The Vatican is a country and is tiny (the smallest in the world). The Vatican City is home to approximately 920 full-time residents and approximately 3000 people who work at the Vatican City and commute into the country from the greater Rome metropolitan area.</p>

							<p><span class="bold">St Peter's</span> also has a train station, St Pietro. Commuter style trains loop around Rome to Termini Station, but the station is of most practical use to those travelling from Civitavecchia, the cruise port for Rome. However, it is a 10 minute walk to <span class="bold">St Peter's</span> Square from the station.</p>

							<p>There are many Rome city buses that pass or terminate next to the Vatican. The number 40 and 64 bus shuttle very frequently between Termini and the Vatican via the City Centre including the Piazza Venezia for the Roman Forum/Colosseum. Unfortunately there is no central bus stop or station that every bus route goes through.</p>

							<p>The crowded Rome Metro has a station just outside the Vatican walls at Ottaviano-S. Pietro. Line A of the Metro runs through with trains every few minutes. Its a 5 minute walk from the Metro to both <span class="bold">St Peter's</span> Square and the<span class="bold">Vatican Museums</span>. You can use Line A of the Metro to go to the Basilica of St John Lateran on the other side of the city situated close by San Giovanni Metro Station.   You can also use the Metro to quickly travel to the Colosseum changing trains to Line B at Termini Station.</p>

							<p><span id="bold"><a href="http://www.romecabs.com">RomeCabs</a></span>, a private car-service firm, provide airport transportation as well as tours all over Italy.</p>
							<p><span class="bold">Note:</span> If you are flying through Fiumicino ( Leonardo da Vinci) airport (FCO), then normally taxies will charge you a fixed rate of 40 Euro for up to four passengers. (the price is 30 Euro from Ciampino airport) A couple of things to remember: <p>1. Go to the official taxi stand. Follow the airport  signs as you leave baggage claim to go outside to the Taxi area. There you'll see a line of cabs.</p><p> 2. Do not respond to those offering taxi services inside the airport or even outside on the curb, apart from the official taxi stand.</p><p> 3. The official price is posted on a sign right near the head of the taxi line. It is 40 Euro to anywhere within the city walls -- that includes the Vatican area. </p>
