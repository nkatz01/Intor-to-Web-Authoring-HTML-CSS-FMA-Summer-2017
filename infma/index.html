				<h2>About the city</h2>
				<article>
					<!-- source:http://www.history.com/news/10-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-vatican and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City -->
					<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City"><span class="bold">Vatican City</span></a> is a country located within the city of Rome. Encircled by a 2 mile border with Italy, it is the smallest country in the world. It covers an area of approximately 110 acres  and has a population of 1,000.  It is an independent state and it is governed by an absolute monarchy with the pope at its head.  With its beautiful architecture , rich history and important significance to millions of people, being the home of the Catholic faith, it attracts millions of visitors a year. The country has its own flag and national anthem, prints its own euro and stamps and even operates its own media outlets.</p>
					<h3>History</h3>
					<p>Under the Roman Empire, many villas and gardens were constructed in that area that had already then been called "Vatican". <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligula">Emperor Caligula</a>,  who lived in between around 12 - 41 AD ,  built in the city gardens a circus for charioteers that was later completed by Nero Caesar .  The famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Peter%27s_Square#Obelisk">Vatican Obelisk</a> is one of his projects. This area later became the site of martyrdom of many Christians. It is said that it was in this circus that Saint Peter was crucified upside-down.  The Constantinian basilica was built in year 326 AD over what was believed to be the tomb of Saint Peter.</p>
					<p>Even before the arrival of Christianity, it is assumed that this part of Rome, which was originally not available for habitation, had been considered  sort of sacred.  A shrine dedicated to one of the Greek goddesses remained active long after Christian landmarks had been erected.</p>  
					<p>Following the building of Constantinian Basilica of St. Peter's, the area become more populated in connection with activity at the basilica and as early in the 5th century, during the period of office of  Pope Symmachus, a palace for the pope was constructed nearby.</p>
					<h3>Tourism today</h3>
					<p>Vatican City generates revenue from tourists visiting the religious and cultural sites that the city is full of such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Peter%27s_Square">St. Peter's Basilica</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistine_Chapel">Sistine Chapel</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_Museums">Vatican Museums</a>. They contain some of the world's most famous paintings and sculptures.  It also features some of the most beautiful gardens. The money that tourists spend on museum admission fees, sales of stamps and mementos, and the sale of publications and literature is providing a unique economy to the city. </p>

					<p>Visiting the Vatican was an amazing experience. It blew me away. If you have a passion for art and history as I do, I can assure you that you will not regret it. I would strongly recommend though that sign up to a tour as the volume of what there is to see is so huge that it can be quite overwhelming and during the high season, you can have up to 25,000 people going through those doors at the <span class="bold">Vatican Museums</span>. A tour guide can pick out the most interesting pieces for you to show in a reasonable amount of time as well as give you very voluble background of what it is that you're looking at. Going together with a tour group can also help you skip the long cues if you're going later in the day. But of course,  if you're smart, start early, before 8 in the morning. This is how I did it and it was well worth it. </p>		
					<p>Just to give you a glimpse of the sheer beauty and magnificence that is awaiting you,  I will tell you about a few of the famous art works in the <span class="bold">Sistine Chapel</span> and the Vatican Museums.  First there is the famous fresco in the Chapel painted  by Michelangelo, commissioned by pope  Pope Julius II 1508 and 1512. They say that only half the Fresco took Michelangelo  3 years to paint. The details are so fine and intimate that you can stand there for hours  craning your neck and not stop being amazed by them.  He did this all by standing on scaffolding which caused him back issues later in life. He is said to have refused at first painting it because he was a sculptor and considered painting below him. Nevertheless, he ended up painting some outstanding works most of which he was not initially supposed to paint. </p>
					<p>Some of his amazing paintings you see there include the 12 apostles, 9 stories of the book of Genesis, of which the most famous one is The Creation Of Adam, along with 12 prophets and various other figures. There is also, behind the chapel's alter, the very famous painting of him called The Last Judgement which took him 5 years to complete. There are also works of other famous artists like Botticelli, Perugino  and Raphael. </p>	
					<p>It took us a good 4 hours to see only the major works but in all honesty you can probably spend there for days if you wanted to examine in detail all the arts and architecture in this place. I went from my visit with real awe and inspiration of those most talented figures in history that have definitely revolutionized the arts of their time. </p>

					<h4>Review by Roger Pickles</h4>
					<figure><img id="stpetersbasilica" src="media/stpeter'sbasilica.jpg" alt="St. Peter's Basilica"><figcaption>Phote by reviewer. The St. Peter's Basilica</figcaption></figure> <!--https://www.viator.com/tours/Rome/Early-Access-Sistine-Chapel-and-Vatican-Museums-Ticket/d511-3731SISTINE-->
					<p>Me and my husband have had the  most amazing holiday in Rome this Summer but the pinnacle of our visit was arguably our visit to the Vatican and in particular the <span class="bold">Vatican Museums</span> and St. Peter's Basilica. They are both examples of the creative genius of the human intellect. For example there are corridors in the Vatican Museums which Ignazio Danti painted in the 1500s. They feature topographical maps of the whole of Italy. They're called the Gallery of Maps. They have the most gorgeous 3-ceilings too.</p>	
					<p>We were most bewildered by the famous four rooms called the Raphael Rooms, they're part of the papal apartments that is open to the public. Their walls show the most well known and priceless paintings like the Disputation of the Holy Sacrament and The famous School of Athens. That's where the famous portrayal of Plato, Aristotle and Socrates comes from. You'd be surprised to hear that Raphael, the painter of this picture, put himself in the painting as well as his contemporary Michelangelo, probably out of his admiration for the latter's skill and style from which art from then on was greatly influenced. In this Museum there is also Michelangelo's famous Pieta sculpture housed in a box surrounded with glass, the only work that the artist himself signed. </p>
					<p>And then the big massive dome of the great St. Peter's Basilica, also designed by Michelangelo. A view of that would leave you stunned for a long time. The church took more than a 100 years to build. Learning about the building of it, the popes that reined in there and the history of the Swiss Guard and all the artwork and sculptures reveals a new world of the past that doesn't cease to amaze me. </p>
					<p>My tour guide, with the Walks of Italy agency was a very nice and patient lady who knew her stuff excellently and was actually teaching those subjects on a course in one of the universities nearby, which really added spice to the visit.  She ended the tour at the St. Peter's Basilica where she left us to our own to explore the architecture and design in its grandeur. Remember if you want to have a visit to remember, visit the Vatican and visit the Church. But note, although there are a lot of naked people on the frescos and the walls of these buildings, the people coming to look at them have to be shoulders and knees covered, in order to enter. This applies to both women and man. (That's only if you visit the Church). </p>
