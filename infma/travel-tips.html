					<h3>Hints on how to visit the vatican museums</h3>
					<p>First, because of the huge crowds that come to visit, if at all possible make your way first thing in the morning, ahead of the large crowds.  </p>
					<p>Second , unless you are on a tight budget, avoid going to the Free Entry Days due to the massive crowds that attempt to this very same thing. Having done this in the past it took a long time to go through the <span class="bold">museum</span>, much longer than past visits, when arriving early in the day. </p>
					<p> Third, do not take a backpack with you. You will need to check this in upon entering the <span class="bold">museum</span>. This can be frustrating and a waste of your time upon entering and when you leave the museum.</p>
					<p>Fourth, if you are able to visit first thing in the morning, make sure you bring smaller Euro notes for entry tickets. </p>
					<p> Fifth, know how to visit the <span class="bold">Vatican</span> and  <span class="bold">St. Peter's Basilica</span>. Many find it is best to visit the Vatican first. There is an approximately twenty minute walk between the two attractions. By visiting  St. Peter's Basilica second, you will find yourself closer to the historic city upon finishing the attractions, this can be a life saver for your feet if you planning to walk into the historic centre after your visits, as so many choose to do. </p>
					<p>Lastly, a common mistake visitors make in the  Vatican is to make a beeline for the  <span class="bold">Sistine Chapel </span> and ignore the world-class art that is all around them, along the way. While this is understandable for those having to make a rushed visit to the museum, it is equally unfortunate. For example, the Stanze di Raffaello (Raphael Rooms), which are just before the Sistine Chapel, are just remarkable rooms yet so many people rush and push their way through, not paying any attention to what they are rushing past.</p>

						<h4>Accessibility</h4>
						<p>Vatican wheelchair access at St. Peter’s Basilica is possible by a combination of wheelchair ramps and elevators. There is a wheelchair ramp near the metal detectors, an elevator near the gift shop, and a wheelchair ramp in the portico leading up into the church. Vatican disabled access inside St. Peter’s Basilica is over a flat, smooth (and huge) floor. Accessible guided tours of the Vatican are possible by booking in advance.</p>

					<h3>Culture</h3>
					<p>Italy is rich in culture, history and traditions. Italians are very proud of their past and therefore fond of their identity (and their family, too). Although foreigners do assume otherwise, Italians tend to be very patriotic and are united under the same language - spoken with different accents and dialects - the same religion (90% is Catholic), the same passions... fashion, food, and sport (soccer, of course).</p>
					<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Italy">Northern</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Italy">Central</a> Italy tend to be more industrious and educated, while the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Italy">Southern</a> part of the country is more rural and laid back. You can breathe history everywhere you go and that shows the respect this country pays to its artistic and historical heritage. Their keen eye for artistic beauty makes the Italian people very aware of their look. Things to like about Italians are their natural inclination to socialize with all kinds of people and their sense of humor! </p>
					<p>Italians are usually friendly, although the visitors should always remember they are guests in a foreign country and can't expect Italians to be at their beck and call. If some places are very touristy, it doesn't mean that all people there can be regarded as employees of tourist offices, always ready to solve all your problems or to answer all your questions... You have to beware of gypsies in big cities (such as Rome), theft is very common, especially in Naples and Rome.</p>
					<p>It is definitely worthwhile to learn a few Italian phrases. If you absolutely want to use just English, a rule of politeness would require you to ask "Do you speak English?" and to wait for "yes" or "no" when addressing an unknown person. Ask the locals where to eat, your best meals will be discovered this way.</p>

					<h3>Eat</h3>
					<p>Little is known about authentic Italian food until you actually get to Italy and you are reading an Italian menu. Where are the spaghetti with meatballs? Fettucine Alfredo? You will find none of that in Italy: those are in fact  Italian American dishes.
					Northern, Central and Southern Italian cuisines are actually very different from each other - in the North, you'll find dishes that include different types of meat such as veal, rabbit, game (deer), horse steak (called "cavallo" or "puledro"), along with the ordinary chicken, turkey, beef, and duck. Salads are usually served as a side dish (not as an appetizer) and fruit can be served as dessert, along desserts at the end of the meal; there is no such thing as frosting in Italy, but a more delicate whipped cream.</p>
					<p>In Southern Italy, food is richer in spices and changes flavor a little bit: you will find pasta everywhere - however, in Northern Italy risotto is more widespread than pasta, whose shapes may be called in a different way depending in which part of the country you're in. However, spaghetti seems to be the universal word while ziti is not!
					Don't leave Italy without trying their delicious ice cream: it looks like a soft serve ice cream, only creamier and in different flavors! Pizza is an absolute must! If you have dinner at a pizzeria your pizza will be served to your table on individual dishes, that's why you need to pick your own pizza and then (maybe) share it, if you are in company.  </p>
					<p>If you order coffee (caffè) at a restaurant or at a bar, their "regular" coffee is an espresso, so make sure you order a caffè americano if it is indeed the regular American coffee you mean to ask for. There is no cream in bars and restaurants in Italy, so your only alternative to a black coffee is milk (latte, not to be confused with the homonymous beverage they serve at Starbuck's). There are many kind of coffee drinks: macchiato (literally "spotted", it's espresso + a drop of milk), corretto (literaly "adjusted", it's espresso + liqueur), cappuccino, lungo, ristretto, marocchino... Beware when they will ask you if you like it steamed or cold! Caldo (hot)? Or freddo (cold)?</p>
					<p>There are some other differences between Italian American cuisine and real Italian one. Cappuccino  can be found only at breakfast, since in Italy breakfast consists mainly of sweet food. You will not find a cappuccino in a restaurant and they will not serve you eggs and bacon in a bar for breakfast. There is no cream in the carbonara, since the original recipe includes only eggs, guanciale (the cheek of the pig), pecorino cheese and black pepper. "Pepperoni" isn't an Italian word, if you ask for peperoni (with no doubles) you will receive peppers, so don't order a "pepperoni pizza" unless you mean a pizza with peppers. Pizza usually has thin crust in the North and thick crust in the South, but you can find some original Southern pizza even in Northern Italy. Pasta can never be a side dish. It's a "primo". In Italy the meal is composed of Antipasti (appetizers), Primo (ONLY pasta, rice or soup), Secondo (main dish), Contorno (side dish), dessert, coffee and "ammazzacaffè" (literally "coffee killer") that is a small shot of highly alcoholic drink.  </p>

				<h3>Weather</h3>
					<p>In general the climate in Rome, and especially Florence and the Tuscan region is very mild. There are little differences between the regions, though. Rule of thumb: at the coast and in the valleys the summers are hotter than in the hilly areas, where the climate is very continental – rain falls are more often.</p>
					<p>Usually the summers in Tuscany are without rain and very hot, especially in the valleys. Spring (April and May) and autumn (October and November) might be rainy but there are still dry, sunny days. In the winter there are sunny, mild days but at night it sometimes gets very cold. July is the hottest month with temperatures from 73° up to 86°. Especially in the valleys the temperatures sometimes rise up high. 
					<p>In the coldest month – January - they are about 44° at the coast and about 38° to 42° inside the country. Of course the temperature in the mountainous areas is below. 
					<p>Tourist season:	The main season is spring, summer and autumn, especially because the landscape at that time of the year is very beautiful. For going sightseeing the summer months are sometimes too hot and the <span class="bold">museums</span> and cities are overcrowded. For sightseeing tours the winter month could be contemplated. During the last years family vacations in Tuscany during the summer got more and more attractive</p>
					<p>October is less crowded but be prepared for rain--about 3 inches for the month in Rome and Florence and Naples.  There are still sunny days, but possibilities of several days of rain.
